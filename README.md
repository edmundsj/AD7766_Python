# Python SCPI Interface for AD7766
This contains an Arduino sketch for communicating with the AD7766 via an Arduino using [SCPI commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Commands_for_Programmable_Instruments) with python.

## Features
- SCPI Communication with Arduino-based devices
- Python interface requests data from the arduino using standard SCPI commands
- Data stored in numpy arrays and written to .csv files
- Documented on readthedocs [link]()

## Getting Started
I assume you know how to use git. If not, you can download the files you need directly off the git website. I also assume you are familiar with the Arduino and Arduino IDE and have it installed on your PC.
