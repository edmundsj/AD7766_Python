Getting Started
==============================================
Before you are able to use the python interface, you will need to have uploaded compatible code to an Arduino, or be using an existing SCPI tool. For information on how to do that, see `the documentation on readthedocs
<https://pythonarduino-ad7766.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

If you have not already done so, download the project repository from githib:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/edmundsj/AD7766_Python.git

Next, navigate to the ``examples`` folder in the project directory. In that directory, there is a basic example (called ``basic.py``), which creates an SCPI device, performs a measurement, configures the device to measure more data, and then fetches that data. Finally, the device is "closed" (this is necessary for the ``pyvisa`` library used not to explode in horror).

Hello World Example
---------------------
If you run this script you should see an output that looks something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   Data from single measured data point: [167]
   Data from multiple measurements: [183 182 182 182 182 181 182 182 182 181]
   Same data, sent again from the Arduino: [183 182 182 182 182 181 182 182 182 181]

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not see the data output, there are a couple potential reasons
**1. Device Not plugged in**
This is probably the most common, and I have errors that should tell you this

**2. Baud Rate is not correct**
Make sure the baud rate is the same on the Arduino and the python script. In the test script 'basic.py' it defaults to 115200, but if you call SCPIDevice() with no arguments, it will default to 115200.

Checking ADC Data Rate
------------------------
In the ``examples/`` folder there is a file called ``adc_speedtest.py``, which reads a large number of samples from the ADC and reports the data rate. This should be close to 125kS/s, or 375kB/s. There is some overhead associated with beginning the measurement which should get asymptotically smaller as the number of sampled bytes increases. The data rate I measure at 10M samples is 124.9kSps.

Running the full Test Suite
--------------------------
To run the full test suite, which runs a stress test on the communication between the device and the python library, in addition to testing all the auxiliary and post-processing functions, run:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python -m unittest discover
